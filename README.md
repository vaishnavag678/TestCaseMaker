# TestCaseMaker

IDEA:
    1) we will be making a wide range test case generator for various types of questions.
    
    2) It will cover various types of standards question
    
Problem usually faced: we miss out some corner cases and big test cases ...which we will try to cover upto 80-90% which will increase the accuracy.
